**************************** Promise, Async and Await ****************************

Promise - 
    A Promise is an object that represents a value that is NOT available yet, but will be available later (or fail).

    pending   → still waiting
    fulfilled → success, value available
    rejected  → failed, error available

    Once fulfilled or rejected → it never changes again.

Async - 
    async does NOT make code asynchronous.
    async means the function ALWAYS returns a Promise.
    async changes return type — always.

Await - 
    await extracts the value from a Promise.

Async and Await Guidelines:
    - If there is await, there must be async.
    - If there is async, there may or may not be await.
    - await is used only when you need to wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing.
    - If a function is synchronous, don’t use await or async.
    * A function can be async EVEN IF it is not written with async.

**************************** Summary ****************************

Promise → future value
async keyword → wraps return value into Promise
await → unwraps value from Promise
returns Promise → async behavior
no Promise → sync behavior

**************************** Why “returns a Promise = async” ****************************

Promises represent future values
Async operations (DB, network, file) cannot give results immediately
So they return Promises

Therefore: Any function that returns a Promise is async by nature.

Even if:
it is NOT written with async
it uses callbacks internally
it’s from a library


**************************** Module Systems in JavaScript ****************************

module js -
    import/export statements
common js - 
    require() to import module exports to export



app.use -> middleware and configurations
